 Replacement roller for Silhouette Cameo 3

This is a roller that can be clipped onto the Silhouette Cameo 3 roller to either replace a broken one, to add extra grp or to accomdate different paper or cutting sheet sizes.
In includes some screwdriver slots to easily remove it once clipped on.

The design is in SCAD.
There are some tunable parameters at the start of the file for height, inner/outer roller diameter etc.

I sliced with Cura version 5.1, 20& infill in PLA, with bed touching tree supports.

Will likely need some small amount of finishing to fit well. I used a hand reamer to get the rod diameter spot on but a drill should work fine.
